# Part 3
## Semantic Similarity 
### Will contain the following:
- embeddings
- measuring distances
- tree.py shows the word to vectors correlation and diplays the way the model works for each individual input (this case being tree)
- semantic_similarity.py is the overall working model that utilizes a imported dictionary of words to compares their vector similarities.
